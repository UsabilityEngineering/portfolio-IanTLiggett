# Navigating Amazon.com

11/10/2025

A while ago I was attempting to use Amazon’s website, amazon.com, to access a movie. I assumed it would be simple, though I was unfamiliar with the website, and went there largely because I thought it was likely it would have it.

When I got to the main page of the website I attempted to search the name of the movie in the search bar, but I got completely unrelated results for other products, as well as some products related to the movie, and critically, not the movie itself. Nowadays I know the side panel to the left has options to filter by movies, which would have worked, but because it was so cluttered I did not see this at the time.

I went back to the main page and began searching for a movies only section, but failed to see it in the top bar, so spent significant time searching before finally opening the menu labeled “All” and seeing Prime Video clearly labeled.
Now that I was actually on prim e video, I found the movie in no time. However now I wasn’t sure how to tell whether it was accessible through prime video or if I’d have to buy it even with prime video, and since I was on a different computer I had to log in to find out. After logging in I was able to tell I didn't have the movie and so rented it, and finally managed to play the movie.

Despite the website being pretty conventional I still struggled to navigate it because there were so many things on the screen. I was missing details or taking a long time to scan it for what I wanted. This made it rather **inefficient** to use. It was also not very **learnable** due to the amount of information you have to process all at once if you go to the main page.
